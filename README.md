## Pallet Management - Where Are My Pallets?

```bash

```

Deployed Version : https://pallet-management.herokuapp.com

## Information

Some loads require pallet change, meaning the truck gives empty pallets at the loading place, in exchange for the goods, and then will receive (the same) amount of empty pallets at the offloading place, in exchange for the goods.

But sometimes, the offloading place 'forget' to give them back, or the driver forget them as well. Or sometimes the client doesn't know the exact amount of pallets to change, so the carrier gives more pal than he should, and than he will get back from the warehouse.

This website will help you follow and check the loads with exchange. The history of the loads will enable you to see, which recurrent warehouses give problem.
